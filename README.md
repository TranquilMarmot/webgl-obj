webgl-obj
=========

Made over the course of 24 hours for CodeDay Seattle 2013.

Loads and renders 3D models in the Wavefront obj file format using WebGL.

Written in pure JavaScript using GLSL shaders I had written for a previous 3D rendering engine.

This was my first time ever using Javascript, so some of the code may not be best practice.
